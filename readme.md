### Introduction

This project is a simple yet functional text editor built with Jetpack Compose. It was designed to demonstrate my ability to implement custom UI components and manage state effectively in a modern Android application. The app supports rich text editing with hyperlinks, allowing users to switch seamlessly between viewing and editing modes.

### Features

#### Viewing Mode
- **Link Interaction:** In this mode, users can tap on hyperlinks embedded within the text to open them in a browser.
- **Switch to Editing Mode:** Tapping on non-link text switches the editor to Editing Mode, allowing for further text modifications.

#### Editing Mode
- **Text Editing:** Users can freely edit the text.
- **Link Interaction:** Clicking on a link while in Editing Mode opens the link and switches the editor back to Viewing Mode.
- **Customized Text Handling:** The editor supports custom text handling, ensuring that hyperlinks are correctly formatted and functional.

### Technical Implementation

#### Custom Components
- **Low-Level Control:** The app uses low-level components like `BasicTextField` and `ClickableText` instead of higher-level components. This decision allows for precise control over the text editor’s behavior, such as custom styling and interaction handling.
- **Custom Link Handling:** Hyperlinks are manually detected and styled within the text, giving the app a polished, controlled behavior that aligns with its purpose.

#### State Management and Persistence
- **ViewModel for State Management:** The editor’s state is managed using Jetpack's `ViewModel`, ensuring that the state persists across configuration changes (like device rotation) without losing data.
- **Data Persistence with DataStore:** To preserve the editor’s content between sessions, `DataStore` is used for efficient and reliable local storage. This modern alternative to `SharedPreferences` ensures that user data is stored safely and is easily retrievable.

#### Memory Management
- **Context Management:** The `Context` is passed only when necessary to the ViewModel to prevent potential memory leaks, adhering to Android's best practices for lifecycle-aware components.

### Potential Improvements

#### Additional Features
- **Rich Text Formatting:** Implementing features like bold, italic, underline, and bullet points would greatly enhance the text editor’s functionality.
- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Implementing an undo/redo stack would allow users to revert accidental changes, improving the usability of the editor.
- **Image Embedding:** Enabling users to embed images within their text would turn the editor into a more comprehensive tool for creating rich content.

#### Using Libraries
- **Compose Rich Text Library:** While the current implementation offers extensive control, integrating the [Compose Rich Text library](https://github.com/MohamedRejeb/compose-rich-editor) could simplify the development process and add powerful rich text editing capabilities out-of-the-box. This would be especially beneficial if the project required more advanced text formatting features or needed to be delivered within a tight timeline.

#### Performance Enhancements
- **Lazy Loading:** For large texts, implementing lazy loading for content could improve performance, ensuring that only the visible portion of the text is rendered at any given time.
- **Optimized Text Rendering:** Further optimizations in text rendering could be implemented to handle large documents more efficiently.

### Conclusion

This project showcases a custom-built text editor in Jetpack Compose, emphasizing flexibility and control over text handling. It highlights my capability to manage state, handle lifecycle events, and create responsive, user-friendly UIs.

While the app currently fulfills its core purpose effectively, integrating additional features and considering third-party libraries could further enhance its functionality and user experience. This balance between custom solutions and leveraging existing libraries demonstrates my understanding of both in-depth customization and efficient development practices.

I look forward to discussing how these skills can contribute to your team and projects!
